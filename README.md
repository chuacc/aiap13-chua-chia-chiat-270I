***Choice of models for machine learning task:***
In this ML assessment, the objective is to predict the occurence failure of car.
This is a supervised classification problem.
Models suitable are such as :
- Random Forest
- Supported vector classifier
- Ensemble Decision Tree
- Gradient Boost classifier

***Evaluation matrics***
Assuming this automotive company is a car leasing company and maintainence of the car is under the responsibility of the company. F1 score, precision and recall are suitable evaluation metric. A good precision would mean less false positive would help the company to save some cost if the maintanence cost are high as car less prone to failure are not serviced too regularly compared to car with higher possibility of failure.
